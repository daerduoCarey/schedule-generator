Reason for the package 'visibilityModifiers'

-I want a 'clean' interface for the users of this jar. Therefore I hide the internally used methods with the modifier 'protected'.

-I want a 'clean' structure of the project. Therefore I want the test classes in a separate folder and package.

=> The test classes are dying to test the methods, but can't see them due to the protected modifier.

Enter the visibilityModifiers. These extends the desired classes and change the visibility of said methods.
